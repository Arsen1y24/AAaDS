# Meal Delivery Routing Problem

This project addresses a **meal delivery routing problem** on the campus of Constructor University, modeled as a **directed, weighted graph**.

### Problem Description

- All vehicles **start and end at a single warehouse**.  
- A set of **customer delivery requests** is provided.  
- A fleet of **vehicles with limited capacities** is available to fulfill the orders.  

The **primary objective** is to **minimize the total completion time**, defined as the moment when the **last vehicle returns to the warehouse** after completing all assigned deliveries.

### Features

- Simulation of delivery routes for multiple vehicles.  
- Consideration of **vehicle capacity constraints**.  
- Route planning algorithms including **greedy heuristics** and **Monte Carlo grouping**.  
- Visualization of delivery plans on the campus map.  

### Visualization

Delivery routes are visualized on a campus map.

Vehicles are represented with distinct colors, showing their movement over time.

Nodes represent warehouse, delivery points, and intersections.

### Objective

The system is designed to efficiently assign deliveries to vehicles and optimize the overall completion time, taking into account traffic, road distances, and vehicle capacity limitations.
