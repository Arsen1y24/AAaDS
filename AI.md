# AI Usage Declaration

СhatGPT was used as assistant during the design and implementation of several components.
The usage was focused on producing base structure of the classes mentioned below, and helping with structural organization.

###  **Greedy Planner**
**Files:** `basic.py`

ChatGPT provided:
- The base empty functions:  
  - `assign_requests_greedily`  
  - `route_cost`  
  - `build_plan` 

All  adjustments, including return to the base after reaching capacity, safety checks, as well as
overall idea and plan for the greedy algorithm were written manually

###  **Monte Carlo Grouping**
**Files:** `grouping_monte_carlo.py`

ChatGPT provided:
- The **initial draft of the structure** 
- Initial empty functions:  
  - Random grouping  
  - Nearest neighbour ordering
- Improvement of basic iterative loop 

---

###  **Standard Monte Carlo**
**Files:** `mcts.py`

ChatGPT contributed:
- Base structure draft for the Monte Carlo planner  
- Debugged random plan generator

This served as a simple baseline;

---

### **HTML Visualizer**
**Files:** `html_map.py`

This visualizer was generated by ChatGPT, including:
- Page layout, CSS styling, dark theme
- JSON embedding  
- Frontend logic for drawing nodes, edges, and vehicle paths

We only made small fixes manually to make it appear prettier.

### Other contributions
AI tools were sometimes used to:
- give function names to make the code more readable.
- improvements during debugging
- Structurize .md files
